# Make this website better

## This was coding take home for [Etch](https://etch.co)

### The task

This coding challenge is for people who want to work with us at [Etch](https://etch.co).

We’d like you to fork this repo, make the website better and open a pull request.

There’s no right or wrong answer, we simply want to see what you’re interested in.

## My Approach

### First thoughts/impressions

- Context: Site is a simple form submit to apply for a job at Etch.
- Design: Site design is inconsistent with Etch's main site and branding.
- Accessibility: There are accessibility issues with the contract of the hero and footer. Lack of form accessibility labels and image aria.
- Functionality: Serval navbar links don't work. Submission form works could be improved.

### Plan

I decided to keep my plan for the site simple, mostly focussing on fixing issues and aligning styling with the brand. I decided to keep the project in vanilla HTML and CSS, as to best show these skills with adding unnecessary complexity or time-commitment to the challenge. 

I gave myself a **time limit of 1 Sunday afternoon (~3 hours)** to prevent the task scope growing unnecessarily.

1. Change the nav bar, hero and footer to be more inline with Etch branding - whilst keeping current page ideas.
2. Improve form styles and functionality.
4. Final changes and Tidy code inline with best practices.
5. Documentation/README guide for hiring manager (i.e. the README you're reading here)
